# Bio.Tools Selector

Javascript-based dropdown field for searching and selecting biotools resources

### About

[See Demo](https://njall.github.io/biotools_selector/dist/index.html)

Bio.tools Selector lets developers add a component to their site which will enable users query the [biotools API](https://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html) and 
select a tool. It caches queries in memory for efficiency.

Bio.tools Selector is built on top of [choices.js](https://github.com/jshjohnson/Choices), so the selector can be extended
to use any of the extensive configuration options provided by the library. [See demo for more](https://joshuajohnson.co.uk/Choices/)
